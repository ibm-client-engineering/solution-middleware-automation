### Requirements for the role

At the moment this role requires a lot of specific settings in the inventory:

```
[mqipt_hosts]
mqipt ansible_host=<MQIPT HOST IP> ansible_user=<SYSTEM USER FOR ANSIBLE>

[washington]
ceng-wdc1-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 1> mq_role=primary
ceng-wdc2-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 2> mq_role=standby
ceng-wdc3-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 3> mq_role=standby

[dallas]
ceng-dal1-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 4> mq_role=primary
ceng-dal2-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 5> mq_role=standby
ceng-dal3-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 6> mq_role=standby

[washington:vars]
ansible_port=22
ansible_user=<ANSIBLE USER IF DIFFERENT>
queuemgr='<QUEUE MANAGER ON THIS CLUSTER>'
keypath='/var/mqm/vols/<QM>/qmgr/<QM>/ssl/defaultSSLKeyFile.kdb'
private_key_file=keys/<PATHTOSSHKEY>_pem
load_balancer="<OUR REGIONAL LOADBALANCER FOR THIS CLUSTER>"
## Add this line to inventory if using a bastion host as ssh proxy
ansible_ssh_common_args='-l <USER> -i <path to ssh pem> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ProxyCommand="ssh -l <USER> -i <path to pem> -W %h:%p -q <BASTION HOST IP"'

[dallas:vars]
ansible_port=22
ansible_user=<ANSIBLE USER IF DIFFERENT>
queuemgr='<QUEUE MANAGER ON THIS CLUSTER>'
keypath='/var/mqm/vols/<QM>/qmgr/<QM>/ssl/defaultSSLKeyFile.kdb'
private_key_file=keys/<PATHTOSSHKEY>_pem
load_balancer="<OUR REGIONAL LOADBALANCER FOR THIS CLUSTER>"
## Add this line to inventory if using a bastion host as ssh proxy
ansible_ssh_common_args='-l <USER> -i <path to ssh pem> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ProxyCommand="ssh -l <USER> -i <path to pem> -W %h:%p -q <BASTION HOST IP"'
```

In our example above, we define the hosts and we set a `primary` node for each cluster. This isn't conducive to failovers in this revision of the role.

We also set a `queuemgr` for each group as it's specific to that cluster. The milage may vary on different types of MQ configurations, but this is a variable that can be overwritten at execution time.

Also in our example, ansible will connect as the root user. For future use, always configure a local user with the correct sudo permissions. This also necessitates the need to define a path to the ssh private key for ansible to use.

The `ansible_ssh_common_args` is used for ansible to connect if you are using a bastion host and not running on the same secured network

When importing this role, it's important to also note that it is useful to have the following
