### MQ Cert Management

> **Warning**
> To prove Ansible's capability to solve the customer's use case, IBM Client Engineering > has built the following Ansible Role for demo purposes. This code and structure is
> going to evolve and change as the engagement progresses.

> **Note**
>** The certification management code is located in the "mq-cert-management-ansible-role" folder in this repository. [Here is a direct link](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-middleware-automation/tree/main/mq-cert-management-ansible-role)

This role allows for simple certificate management in the local keystore on each node of MQ. This works for any RDQM cluster or standalone MQ host.
