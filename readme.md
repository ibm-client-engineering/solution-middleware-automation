# Background and Business Problem
A valued Financial Services customer has approached IBM Client Engineering to formulate a point of view on **automating** manual IT Operations tasks for their IBM middleware landscape. Today, these manual tasks can be error-prone and time consuming.
### Use Cases:

- **Certificate Management:**
Automate the manual workflow of certificate management across the customer's IBM MQ footprint.

# Solution Overview

After gathering data on all the use-cases, this solution will use Ansible as the primary driver for automating operations.

### MQ Cert Management

> **Warning**
> To prove Ansible's capability to solve the customer's use case, IBM Client Engineering > has built the following Ansible Role for demo purposes. This code and structure is
> going to evolve and change as the engagement progresses.

> **Note**
>** The certification management code is located in the "mq-cert-management-ansible-role" folder in this repository. [Here is a direct link](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-middleware-automation/tree/main/mq-cert-management-ansible-role)

This role allows for simple certificate management in the local keystore on each node of MQ. This works for any RDQM cluster or standalone MQ host.

### Requirements for the role

At the moment this role requires a lot of specific settings in the inventory:

```
[mqipt_hosts]
mqipt ansible_host=<MQIPT HOST IP> ansible_user=<SYSTEM USER FOR ANSIBLE>

[washington]
ceng-wdc1-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 1> mq_role=primary
ceng-wdc2-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 2> mq_role=standby
ceng-wdc3-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 3> mq_role=standby

[dallas]
ceng-dal1-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 4> mq_role=primary
ceng-dal2-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 5> mq_role=standby
ceng-dal3-mq1 ansible_host=<HOST IP 6> mq_role=standby

[washington:vars]
ansible_port=22
ansible_user=<ANSIBLE USER IF DIFFERENT>
queuemgr='<QUEUE MANAGER ON THIS CLUSTER>'
keypath='/var/mqm/vols/<QM>/qmgr/<QM>/ssl/defaultSSLKeyFile.kdb'
private_key_file=keys/<PATHTOSSHKEY>_pem
load_balancer="<OUR REGIONAL LOADBALANCER FOR THIS CLUSTER>"
## Add this line to inventory if using a bastion host as ssh proxy
ansible_ssh_common_args='-l <USER> -i <path to ssh pem> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ProxyCommand="ssh -l <USER> -i <path to pem> -W %h:%p -q <BASTION HOST IP"'

[dallas:vars]
ansible_port=22
ansible_user=<ANSIBLE USER IF DIFFERENT>
queuemgr='<QUEUE MANAGER ON THIS CLUSTER>'
keypath='/var/mqm/vols/<QM>/qmgr/<QM>/ssl/defaultSSLKeyFile.kdb'
private_key_file=keys/<PATHTOSSHKEY>_pem
load_balancer="<OUR REGIONAL LOADBALANCER FOR THIS CLUSTER>"
## Add this line to inventory if using a bastion host as ssh proxy
ansible_ssh_common_args='-l <USER> -i <path to ssh pem> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ProxyCommand="ssh -l <USER> -i <path to pem> -W %h:%p -q <BASTION HOST IP"'
```

In our example above, we define the hosts and we set a `primary` node for each cluster. This isn't conducive to failovers in this revision of the role.

We also set a `queuemgr` for each group as it's specific to that cluster. The milage may vary on different types of MQ configurations, but this is a variable that can be overwritten at execution time.

Also in our example, ansible will connect as the root user. For future use, always configure a local user with the correct sudo permissions. This also necessitates the need to define a path to the ssh private key for ansible to use.

The `ansible_ssh_common_args` is used for ansible to connect if you are using a bastion host and not running on the same secured network

When importing this role, it's important to also note that it is useful to have the following

### Role Tasks and Variables

When running this role from a Tower environment or running from cmdline, the following vars are required and/or overwriteable. This is a breakdown per task:

**Task:** `mq-add-pub-cert.yaml`<br>

### Dependencies

A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in regards to parameters that may need to be set for other roles, or variables that are used from other roles.

### Playbook Example

A typical example of using this role would be to first import it via ansible-galaxy and then point a playbook to it.

An example entry in your requirements file in your roles directory:

```
- name MQ Certificate Management
  src: https://github.com/client-engineering-devops/mq-cert-management-role.git
  name: mq-cert-managment-role
  scm: git
  version: main
```
And our playbook would look like this:

```
- hosts: washington,dallas
  become: true
  become_user: root
  gather_facts: true
  roles:
  - role: mq-cert-management-role
```
### Variables

For our orchestrator we would want to set some group vars for this role, particularly ansible vault encrypted tokens or passwords. For our test environment we set our `group_vars/all/main.yaml` with the following variables:

```
smtp_info:
  host: smtp.sendgrid.net
  port: 465
  user: apikey
  pass: "{{ smtp_pass }}"
  auth: true
  from: "IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud<noreply@bpm.ibmcloud.com>"

email_address:
  - Ross Kramer <kramerro@us.ibm.com>
  - Faraz Ahmad <faraz@ibm.com>

# Cert management stuff

sig_alg: "SHA256WithRSA"
expire_time: 90
```

We stored a lot of elements here in the global vars above. Primarily we do this so we can share the variables across multiple roles. These vars however can be very much localized into the role itself via `vars/main.yaml` or `defaults/main.yaml`.

The important variables are `smtp_info` as these are the required vars for the `mail` module in ansible. This allows us to email out. Others are the `github_repo` path. This is necessary in order to update our associated github issue. The `github_issue` var and `email_address` var are just populated with default values that we overwrite with our `extra_vars`.

Ansible vault encryption is how we are protecting our passwords and tokens. These entries are encrypted and are decrypted at run time using the ansible secret. That secret is typically stored in Tower or can be stored in a file to reference at run time when using the ansible-playbook command. Other vars like `sig_alg` and `expire_time` are also set to be default values to use when creating new certificates in the keystores.

Once again, any variable set here can be overwritten with the `extra-vars` flag when running via commandline.

Local Vars:

In our defaults dir we set some default vars. Currently it would look like this:

```
---
# defaults file for mq-cert-management

MQM_BIN_PATH: "/opt/mqm/bin"

company_url: "https://www.ibm.com"
company_logo: "https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/ibm-logo-png/ibm-logo-png-transparent-svg-vector-bie-supply-3.png"
```

This lets us set a default URL and default company logo to use for our email templates.
